# Game Loop in C
This code is just playing around with the most basic implementation of a game loop writen in `C`. It is following 
along with the course at
[Programming a Simple Game Loop with C & SDL](https://pikuma.com/courses/sdl-tutorial-c-game-loop). I departed 
slightly by using CMake and Clion for my tooling. Other than that everything else is the same.
